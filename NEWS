FCT Changes
+++++++++++

Whats new in FCT 1.1
====================

 - BLUEPRINT: sys-multi-file. Better, more robust multi-file support. Although
   it starts to take a toll on the time to code for FCTest, it does help
   provide it a little more extendability to FCTest.
 - CMAKE used for building the FCT tests.
 - Updated all compiles to use the highest warning level and fixed compiler
   warnings.
 - Removed all "assert out of memory" checks and properly checked the memory
   through the entire lifetime of the execution branch.
 - Added fct_req: Function will abort a test block when the requirement is not
   met.
 - Modified fct_chk: Will continue after a failed test.
 - Modified standard logger output to provide a straight continuous line of
   PASS/FAIL statements. Easier to scan failures.
 - Modified failure output to hopefully be less likely to wrap around by using
   a new line to actually show what failed.
 - #376783: Added test to make sure we continue to compile against a C++
   project.
 - #398286: Fixed to use _vsnprintf for Microsoft compilers.
