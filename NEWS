FCT Changes
+++++++++++

Whats new in FCT 1.1
====================

 - BLUEPRINT: sys-multi-file. Better, more robust multi-file support. Although
   it starts to take a toll on the time to code for FCTest, it does help
   provide it a little more extendability to FCTest.
 - CMAKE used for building the FCT tests.
 - #376783: Added test to make sure we continue to compile against a C++
   project.
 - Updated all compiles to use the highest warning level and fixed compiler
   warnings.
 - Removed all "assert out of memory" checks and properly checked the memory
   through the entire lifetime of the execution branch.
 - Added fct_req: Function will abort a test block when the requirement is not
   met.
 - Modified fct_chk: Will continue after a failed test.

Whats new in FCT 1.0.2
======================

 - #382628: Fix tests so teardown gets executed. Added test case.

Whats new in FCT 1.0.1
