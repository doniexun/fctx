FCTest User Documentation
=========================

Welcome
--------

Use Fast C Unit Test as a lightweight tool for quickly generating unit tests in
C/C++. Simply include a header and start typing out your tests.
 
With Fast C Test (FCTest) you can write tests in C/C++ just like you can in
other introspective languages like Java and Python. FCTest does not require a
post-processing step. FCTest does not require registration of your functions.
Declare your test and start writing.
