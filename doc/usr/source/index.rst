FCTest User Documentation
=========================

Overview
--------

Use Fast C Unit Test as a lightweight tool for quickly generating unit tests in
C/C++. Simply include a header and start typing out your tests.
 
With Fast C Test (FCTest) you can write tests in C/C++ just like you can in other
introspective languages like Java and Python. FCTest does not require a
post-processing step. FCTest does not require registration of your functions.
Declare your test and start writing.

Features
--------

The main features of FCTest are summarized as follows,

    1. **It's just a header**. Simply include it into your source file and start
    typing your tests.

    2. **No test registration**. Declare and write your test without running
    any extra post-processing.
