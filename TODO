Milestone 1.4 (Major Enhancements)
==================================


- (P2) Handle different languages for the built-in loggers.

- Unicode Support

- Figure out a way to have a test case without a FCT_BGN/END?

    #include "fct.h"

    FCT_VERY_QUICK(test1)
    {
       FCT_CHECK( ok );    // This should fail, with a hint!
    }
    FCT_VERY_QUICK_END()
    FCT_VERY_QUICK(test2)
    {
       FCT_CHECK( ok );    // This should fail, with a hint!
    }
    FCT_VERY_QUICK_END()

    /* Actually may be impossible. */
